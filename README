This project focuses on db and private chain. When user use create/update/delete,
it will record hash into private chain automatically for improving trustness.
It means user can request private chain for ensure the data in db isn't modified.

However, the implementation doesn't finish. Right now, json file is used instead
of database. So it's just an POC.
